# LICENSES

This contains various licenses and most helpfully provides
some helper code such as c_license.txt and py_license.txt
which can be included in code as desired.

Typically you'll add this as a submodule to a parent project.
See the [submodule section](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
from the [pro git book](https://git-scm.com/book/en/)
